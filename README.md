# Image Codifier based in quantization techniques.
## This Rep. presents the implementation of 3 different codifiers each one with it's own advantages

**The three codifiers implemented in this rep are:**

1. CIQA (based in scalar quantization);
2. CIVQ (based in vector quantization);
3. CIMap (Color map encoding based in vectorial quantization).

The vectorial quantization is based in the **LGB algorithm** and all the implementations of this rep are made in the Octave platform.
